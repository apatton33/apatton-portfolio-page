# apatton-portfolio-page

## Description
    I was tasked through the acceptance criteria to build a portfolio website. This website has my name, a recent photo of me, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. I added a Nav section where you can click on the sections to navigate to the part of the page you would like to go to. I added a section where my future projects will go as we complete them. I made a few sections of the work section different sizes to show abilities in flex box. Enjoy!


## Usage
    After building the site I was able to deploy the site and test functionality. The site is listed below.
